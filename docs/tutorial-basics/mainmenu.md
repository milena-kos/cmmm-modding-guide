# Customizing Main Menu

First, open your mod in Unity. If you don't have a project, please visit [Introduction](../intro).

In the file explorer at the bottom, open `Scenes` folder. Here, double-click `MainMenu`.

Main Menu should now appear. You may be zoomed in, so you might have to scroll out.

Click on whatever text you want to edit. If it selects another element, you can always find your text in the Hierarchy on the left.

Your text component will appear in the Inspector on the right. Here, you will be able to change many properties, such as the text iself, color, size, font, any many more!

More to come, I need to figure out how do I do stuff now.
