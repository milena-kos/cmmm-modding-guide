# Adding a built-in level

First, open your mod in Unity. If you don't have a project, please visit [Introduction](../intro).

In the file explorer at the bottom, open `Scripts` folder. Here, open `Level Data`.

`GameLevels.cs` file contains a list of all in game levels. You can double-click it to open it in the text editor.

Scroll to the bottom, add comma after the last level, and add your new level inside of `"quotation marks"`.

:::danger
Make sure to add comma after every level, or else it will crash!

How you probably already noticed, all levels here all in V1. But, you don't have to stick to it! You can put levels in any saving format you want! (as long as it can be read by the game)

This probably got you asking on how to make your own saving formats, and the next article will be just about that! How convenient!
