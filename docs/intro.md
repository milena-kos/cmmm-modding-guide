# Welcome to CMMM Modding Guide!

Cell Machine Mystic Mod is made in Unity 2019. So, lets get started by installing that.

## Install Unity

Go to https://unity.com/download and grab a version for your OS.

After installing Unity Hub, you will need to download the correct unity version. Simplest way to do this is to follow this link: https://cmmm.glitch.me/unity

When installing Unity, make sure to select platforms you want to build for in the Mono format.

Possible variants:
- Windows build support (Mono)
- MacOS build support (Mono)
- Linux build support (Mono)
- Android build support

Please note that operating system you are currently using won't show up in the menu, as it is already installed.

## Install CMMM source

You will need to get CMMM source code. You can download it [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/982864464179261501/1074987004942635008/Source.zip), but also from [Cell Machine](https://discord.gg/cell-machine-791818283867045941) or [The Trash Server](https://discord.gg/thetrashcell) Discord servers.

Extract the archive, go to Unity Hub, in Projects tab click `Open` and locate your source code folder. If it has unrelated files, such as launcher or READMEs, open `src` folder inside of it.

You have now installed and opened CMMM source code, and Unity project should open shortly!
